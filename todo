Skipping tm353_block_1_part_4.epub -> tm353_block_1_part_4.epub already exists.

Looks like when specifying a filename that doesn't need changing, we don't actually check if it needs changing or not so probably the transformer is applied and then we see it already exists, which it does since the filename didn't change. This does not happen when recursing on the directory, eg. riff -ldr tm353.

Running riff on a directory name doesn't do anything while it should transform the name

"_-_" is ugly. Perhaps an option to make that nicer? "...primavera-allegro..." perhaps?
